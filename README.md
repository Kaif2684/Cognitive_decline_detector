# Cognitive_decline_detector
This Python script implements an end-to-end pipeline for detecting signs of cognitive decline in patients by analyzing their speech samples. It uses both audio signal processing and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract a variety of cognitive markers.
Absolutely! Here's the **final, copy-paste-ready `README.md`** version of your project for GitHub — all cleaned up, with markdown syntax, image placeholders, and proper formatting. Just paste this directly into your GitHub repo’s `README.md` file, and then upload your images into an `assets/` folder in the root of your repo.

> A modular speech intelligence toolkit to detect cognitive stress and decline markers through acoustic and linguistic analysis.

## 🧪 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for detecting potential cognitive decline indicators using a hybrid of:

- 🎤 **Speech signal analysis**
- 📊 **Statistical anomaly detection**
- 🧠 **Natural language understanding**

The system is built to generate **interactive HTML clinical reports** that combine risk scoring, disfluency analysis, and temporal-linguistic visualizations.

## 🧰 Features

### 🎧 Advanced Speech Analysis
- LSTM networks for detecting **temporal pauses and hesitations**
- BERT transformers for analyzing **linguistic complexity**
- HMM-inspired detection of **disfluencies and filled pauses**
- Extraction of **MFCCs, pitch, energy, and prosodic** features

### 🧠 Cognitive Risk Assessment
- **Isolation Forest** for anomaly scoring
- **K-Means clustering** for behavior patterns
- **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Composite scoring: **Low / Medium / High** cognitive risk

### 📋 Professional Reporting
- Clinical-grade HTML reports with:
  - 🔍 Cognitive indicator breakdown
  - 📈 Feature correlation plots
  - 🧑‍⚕️ Individual assessments

## 💾 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cognitive-decline-detection.git
   cd cognitive-decline-detection
   

2. **Install dependencies**
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

   Or install manually:
   bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn librosa soundfile SpeechRecognition scikit-learn torch transformers nltk jinja2
   

3. **Download NLTK resources**
   python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
   

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place `.wav` files into the `audio_bank/` directory.

2. Edit the input section in `main.py`:
   python
   audio_data = [
       {'path': "audio_bank/sample1.wav", 'name': "Patient1", 'age': 65, 'gender': "Male"},
       {'path': "audio_bank/sample2.wav", 'name': "Patient2", 'age': 72, 'gender': "Female"},
       # Add more...
   ]


3. Run the analysis:
   bash
   python main.py

4. Results will be saved in:
   - `clinical_results/clinical_report.html`
   - `clinical_results/cognitive_assessment.csv`
   - Visualization plots (bar charts, heatmaps, feature graphs)
